Crafting software solutions with a focus on the cloud.

I write Go professionally, almost exclusively. I've also worked on Elixir-based projects by choice, drawn to the language and the design of the BEAM, even if opportunities in that space are less frequent.

Currently developing personal and commercial projects in:  
- **Go**  
- **Ruby**  
- **Elixir**

I’ve also spent time with a few Lispy languages. **Racket** remains my favorite. It's probably the most pleasant syntax I’ve ever worked with. I built a couple of small personal projects with **Clojure** and enjoyed the experience, though I’m not using it actively right now. **LFE** caught my attention for combining Lisp-style syntax with the BEAM, which I’ve always found interesting to work with.

In the past, I’ve used **Java** and **Ruby** both professionally and personally.

Languages I've explored and enjoyed include **Gleam**, **Elm**, **Roc**, and **Dart**.

I’m especially interested in DDD, distributed systems, and writing about software design. Outside of work, I like building self-hosted tools that solve specific problems, often small or niche. It’s a way to stay close to the craft and step back for a moment from large-scale infrastructure.

### What I’m working on

Ongoing personal projects, each tackling a problem I find meaningful or interesting:

- [**Hermes**](https://github.com/adrianpk/hermes): a Go-based static site generator, minimal and local-first  
- [**Aquamarine**](https://github.com/aquamarinepk): a kit and generator in progress, with Hermes as a structural reference  
- [**Pulap**](https://github.com/pulap/pulap/): a real estate manager in Elixir  
- [**Tyn**](https://github.com/adrianpk/tyn): a CLI capture tool for links, tasks, notes  
- [**CoreDrift**](https://github.com/coredrift/coredrift): async daily stand-ups for remote teams, moving from Rails to Phoenix

> All these projects are active. Gaps in activity reflect the reality of being a solo developer maintaining them in my spare time, so progress tends to come in bursts.

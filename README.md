### On software and systems

I work primarily with Go and htmx, using domain-driven design as a general compass. I prefer building systems that start simple and can grow without friction, whether they stay as a single service or evolve into a distributed setup. The goal is to keep logic clear and boundaries easy to reason about.

My early career was in Java and Ruby, before Go became my main language. I have also worked on production systems running on the BEAM, mostly with Elixir, and I’ve been exploring Gleam for its type system and straightforward design.

Outside large-scale work I take on smaller projects that aim to solve specific problems sustainably, keeping infrastructure minimal and avoiding unnecessary dependency on external services or even myself.

# Crafting software solutions with a focus on the cloud

In recent years my primary professional focus has been Go, complemented by substantial experience with Elixir in commercial projects that leverage the BEAM.

My current stack includes:
- **Go**
- **Nomad**
- **AWS**

I have professional experience with Java and Ruby, and Ruby has also appeared in recent projects. I have also used Clojure in selected projects, an experience that reinforced my appreciation for functional design. Over time I’ve explored languages that have shaped how I think about software: Elm, for its functional purity; Dart, which I’ve used for small applications and found pragmatic and clear; and Roc, which I see as bringing Elm’s influence into systems and tooling. I continue to explore Gleam, whose static typing feels like a natural extension of the BEAM, and I often turn to Racket for its extensibility and experimental freedom.

I’m especially interested in DDD, distributed systems, and writing about software design. Outside of work I build self-hosted tools that solve specific, often narrow problems, to stay close to the craft while balancing large-scale infrastructure work.

### Selected Projects

- [**Clio**](https://github.com/adrianpk/clio) & [**Hermes**](https://github.com/adrianpk/hermes): Current focus on **Clio** as a local-first SSG; validated ideas will flow back into Hermes.
- **Aquamarine**: Component kit for monoliths and micro-monoliths, paused while I align concepts with a new microservices toolkit.
- [**Pulap**](https://github.com/pulap/pulap) & [**CoreDrift**](https://github.com/coredrift/coredrift-dep): Active private development as they migrate to the new microservices toolkit.
- [**Tyn**](https://github.com/adrianpk/tyn): A CLI capture tool I use daily; nearing completion with incremental refinements.

> All projects are active to varying degrees. Progress comes in cycles, reflecting the realities of maintaining them solo alongside professional responsibilities.

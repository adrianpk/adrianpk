Crafting software solutions with a focus on the cloud.

I write Go professionally, almost exclusively. I've also worked on Elixir-based projects by choice, drawn to the language and the resilience of the BEAM platform, even if opportunities in that space are less frequent.

Currently developing personal and commercial projects in:  
- **Go**  
- **Ruby**
- **Elixir**

I'm also exploring homoiconic languages, an old interest that finally found room to grow:  
- **Racket** – probably the most pleasant syntax I’ve ever worked with  
- **Clojure** – when you need to go big but still want your parens in place 
- **LFE** – parentheses on top of the BEAM, bringing clarity to concurrent systems  
- **Elisp** – I'm a long-time Emacs user, though Neovim has earned its place too  
- **Guile** – mostly because of Guix. It's not my main OS yet, but I'm testing it on a VM and might switch from my current Arch-based setup if nothing critical breaks

In the past, I've used **Java** and **Ruby** both professionally and personally.

Languages I've explored and enjoyed include **Gleam**, **Elm**, **Roc**, and **Dart**.

As for **Rust**, I deeply appreciate the concepts it brings to the table and often wish more languages adopted some of its ideas. That said, each encounter with it has left a mark, and not always in a good mood, as others have pointed out.

I've also given **JavaScript** several chances over the years. I'd like it to click someday, but it hasn’t yet.
